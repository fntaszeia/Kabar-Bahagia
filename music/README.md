# Music Folder

Add your background wedding music here.

## Required File:
- **wedding-song.mp3** - Background music for the invitation

## Recommendations:
- Use a romantic, instrumental track
- Keep the file size reasonable (under 5MB)
- MP3 format works best for web compatibility
- Consider royalty-free music from:
  - YouTube Audio Library
  - Free Music Archive
  - Incompetech
  - Bensound

## Note:
The music player is optional. If you don't want background music, the invitation will work fine without it.
